# IT-Operation-Templates

Welcome to the **IT-Operation-Templates** repository! This collection provides concise, practical templates designed to streamline IT operations and incident management. These templates offer a flexible foundation for documenting standard procedures, handling incidents, and maintaining best practices.

## Features

- **Procedure Templates**: Document standard operating procedures (SOPs) with clear steps, responsibilities, and version control.
- **Incident Templates**: Structured templates for efficient incident response and documentation.
- **Other Useful Templates**: Additional templates for common IT operations, such as reporting issues, handling escalations, and other operational tasks.
- **Changelog and Versioning**: Following [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) best practices for version control and transparency.
- **Multi-language Support**: Templates can be customized in different languages, indicated by a version suffix (e.g., `v1.0.0-en`, `v1.0.0-es`).
- **KISS Principle**: Templates adhere to the "Keep It Simple, Stupid" principle, focusing on simplicity and avoiding unnecessary complexity.

## Philosophy

These templates are short and concise, serving as a **starting point**. They don't cover every scenario but establish a **flexible foundation** that can be tailored to fit the needs of any organization. Over time, more templates will be added as my schedule allows.

## How to Use

1. Fork or clone the repository.
2. Select the template that suits your needs (procedures, incidents, etc.).
3. Customize the template to fit your organization's structure and processes.
4. Use the versioning system to track and manage changes.
5. Remember to follow the **KISS principle**: Keep it simple and avoid unnecessary complexity.
6. **Remember you're working with people, not just machines**: Keep communication clear and human-centered.
7. And before you start documenting procedures... **serve yourself a nice cup of coffee** â˜•!
